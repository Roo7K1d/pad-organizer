# PaD Organizer
The port and domain organizer by RootK1d.

If you're like me, you often forget which ports you forwarded in your router for which project and which domain belongs to which device. I made this little website to help me remember which app uses which ports and whether or not I have open ports for new projects left.

## Installation Guide
- Download the ZIP folder
- Unpack the ZIP
- Upload the folder to your webserver and then visit `http://yoursite.com/pad-organizer`
- You're done!
- If you don't want that other people can access this site you can do this with a [.htaccess file](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216363187-Password-protecting-your-site-with-an-htaccess-file)

## Demo
